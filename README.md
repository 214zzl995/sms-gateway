## üõ†Ô∏è Building From Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.60+ and Cargo
- Node.js 16+ and npm/pnpm
- SQLite

### Step 1: Build the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the frontend
pnpm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory within the frontend folder.

### Step 2: Build the Backend

```bash
# Return to the project root
cd ..

# Build the backend in release mode
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in `target/release/sms-gateway`.

## üöÄ Running the Application

```bash
# Run with default settings
./target/release/sms-gateway

# Specify a custom config file
./target/release/sms-gateway --config /path/to/config.toml

# Set custom log directory
./target/release/sms-gateway --log /path/to/logs

# Set log level
./target/release/sms-gateway --log-level debug
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is configured using a TOML file. By default, it looks for the config file at:
- Debug mode: `./config.toml`
- Release mode: `/etc/sms-gateway/config.toml`

Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and modify according to your setup:

```bash
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

### Basic Configuration

```toml
[settings]
server_host = "0.0.0.0"
server_port = 8080
username = "admin"
password = "your_secure_password"
read_sms_frequency = 30

# Multiple device support
[[devices]]
com_port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
baud_rate = 115200

[[devices]]
com_port = "/dev/ttyUSB1"
baud_rate = 115200
```

### Webhook Configuration

```toml
[[settings.webhooks]]
url = "https://your-endpoint.com/webhook"
method = "POST"

[settings.webhooks.headers]
"Content-Type" = "application/json"

body = '''
{
    "from": "@contact@",
    "message": "@message@",
    "timestamp": "@timestamp@"
}
'''
```

For detailed configuration options including filtering, see `config.toml.example`.
